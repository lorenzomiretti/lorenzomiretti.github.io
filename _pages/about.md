Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher with the <a href='https://www.tu.berlin/en/netit'>Network Information Theory</a> chair at <a href='https://www.tu.berlin/en/'>Technische Universität Berlin</a>, and with the <a href='https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/wn.html'>Wireless Communications and Networks</a> department at the <a href='https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en/'>Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute</a>, both headed by <a href='https://www.tu.berlin/en/netit/prof-dr-ing-slawomir-stanczak'>Prof. Slawomir Stanczak</a>. 

I studied telecommunication engineering at <a href='https://www.polito.it/'>Politecnico di Torino</a>, and I received the Ph.D. degree in wireless communications from <a href='https://www.eurecom.fr/en'>EURECOM</a> and <a href='https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en'>Sorbonne Université</a>, under the supervision of <a href='https://www.eurecom.fr/en/people/gesbert-david'>Prof. David Gesbert</a>. 

My research focus is on communication theory, mathematical optimization, and signal processing for wireless networks.
